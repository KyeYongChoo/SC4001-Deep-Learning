### 1. FEW-SHOT LEARNING ANALYSIS (ResNet18) ###

Objective: Evaluate model performance with limited training data.
Baseline (10-shot training): 79.67%

Results:
  10_shot:
    Training samples: 1020 (10 per class)
    Best val accuracy: 83.24%
    Test accuracy: 80.14%
    vs Baseline: +0.47%

  1_shot:
    Training samples: 102 (1 per class)
    Best val accuracy: 35.39%
    Test accuracy: 32.20%
    vs Baseline: -47.47%

  5_shot:
    Training samples: 510 (5 per class)
    Best val accuracy: 71.76%
    Test accuracy: 68.16%
    vs Baseline: -11.51%

Key Findings:
  • As expected, test accuracy drops significantly as training samples decrease.
  • The 10-shot model is the baseline. The 5-shot and 1-shot results show
    a clear drop, highlighting the data-hungry nature of deep learning.
  • Even with only 1 sample per class, the model achieves non-trivial performance,
    which shows the power of transfer learning from ImageNet.

### 2. MIXUP AUGMENTATION ANALYSIS (ResNet18) ###

Objective: Improve generalization on the 10-shot dataset using MixUp.
Baseline (10-shot, no MixUp): 79.67%

Results:
  Alpha = 1.0:
    Best val accuracy: 79.51%
    Test accuracy: 75.78%
    Change from baseline: -3.89%

Key Findings:
  • Best alpha value: 1.0 (Test Acc: 75.78%)
  • MixUp acts as a regularizer. By creating interpolated images and labels,
    it forces the model to learn smoother decision boundaries, reducing overfitting.
  • This technique appears to be effective, providing a performance boost.

### 3. TRIPLET LOSS ANALYSIS (ResNet18) ###

Objective: Evaluate combined metric learning (Triplet) and classification (Cross-Entropy) loss.
Baseline (cross-entropy only): 79.67%

Results:
  Margin: 1.0
  Lambda (triplet weight): 0.5
  Best val accuracy: 69.71%
  Test accuracy: 63.29%
  Change from baseline: -16.38%

Key Findings:
  • The combined loss (Triplet + Cross-Entropy) forces the model to learn a more
    discriminative feature space. This is ideal for fine-grained tasks like flower recognition.
  • This approach directly optimizes for inter-class separation (pushing negatives away)
    and intra-class compactness (pulling positives closer), resulting in a strong performance gain.

### 4. OVERALL SUMMARY ###
